# selenium-wrapper

It can be a challenge to manage which browsers you can / can't run your tests against
as well as blocking those that have known issues.

This library is a simple set of helpers that helps find the browsers available
in the current environment the tests are run on and adding a set of simple
methods to check for versions and print useful info for logs.
